Describe three different data types.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Bf74n9vmCLqf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["ANSWER =\n","# 1. Strings\n","One of the most widely used data types is a string. A string consists of one or more characters, which can include letters, numbers, and other types of characters. You can think of a string as plain text.\n","A string represents alphanumeric data. This means that a string can contain many different characters, but they are all considered as if they were text, even if the characters are numbers. A string can also contain spaces. This presents a bit of an issue. How are you going to distinguish between the value of a string and the actual code of the program? The solution is to mark the beginning and end of a string with a special character, typically a quote. For example, \n","print\"Hello World\"\n","# 2.Numeric Data Types\n","The second most important data type is numeric data. There are several different ones.\n","An integer is a numeric value without a decimal. Integers are whole numbers and can be positive or negative. Sometimes a distinction is made between short and long integers, referring to how much data storage is used for the number. A short integer is typically stored using 16 bits, which means you can store up to 2^16, or 65,536, unique values. For any number larger than that, you would need to use a long integer, which uses 32 bits or more.\n","A number with a decimal is referred to as a decimal, a float or a double. The terminology varies somewhat with the programming language being used. The term 'float' comes from floating point, which means you can control where the decimal point is located. The term 'double' refers to using double the amount of storage relative to a float. Working with numbers in code is a little bit like using a calculator. Here is an example of how numeric values are used in code, in this case using a multiplication character:\n","\n","result = 3 * 117.89\n","The value stored in the 'result' would be 353.67\n","\n","# 3. Boolean data type\n","The Boolean data type can only represent two values: true or false. Typically, a 1 is used to represent True, and a 0 is used to represent False. Consider the following example where a user inputs two values and the program determines whether the first one is smaller than the second one or not.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Lz1GhtvuCWyG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.
